<h1>Welcome to Bamazon!  The place where all your sporting needs are met!</h1>

This is an Amazon Like database where you can purchase sporting gear.

Included in the images folder are screenshots of the working program.

Each time a user opens customer.js with a proper connection to a mysql database,
they will be prompted to Purchase Products,  View Inventory, or Exit.

Once a product ID is entered, an error will show if the ID is invalid or has 0 inventory
and prompted to choose another ID.  If a proper ID is chosen, data will apear showing the 
name, quantity in stock, and price.  If a quantity higher than the stock quantity is chosen,
the user will be prompted to choose another valid quantity.

After a purchase is made, the user will again have the options to Purchase Products, View Inventory
which will now be updated, or Exit which will generate a receipt with a list and total cost of all items.
If the user Exits without a purchase, no receipt will be available.

After exiting the program, the receipt will be cleared so the next user won't have duplicate items.
